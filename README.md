# Loan-Application-Fraud-Detection

An end-to-end machine learning project that builds a model to predict fraud risk based on applicant data. The notebook covers the full workflow from data exploration to model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

#### Result: Achieved 92.3% accuracy on the test set using a LightGBM model.

Interpretation: Used SHAP to explain the model's predictions, finding that an applicant's Married and Self_Employed status were the most important predictors.

Application: The notebook demonstrates the full workflow, including how to make a prediction on new, unseen data.
